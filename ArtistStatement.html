        <p>Ever since I was a child, digital media has always been a large part of my life, especially in the case of video games. I grew up playing games such as Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda. Along with that, I also watched many animated shows on TV and online such as Sailor Moon or the Winx Club. This soon evolved into a love of Japanese culture as I began to obsess over a plethora of genres in anime and manga in my teens. It was those games and shows that inspired me to become an artist and I often found myself drawing the characters during my free time. I began learning how to draw when I was 13 years old, but my view of the art world expanded very quickly soon after.</p>
        <p>Part of my creative practice includes costume design and creation. I am an avid member of the cosplay community and I post content on social media quite often. My process involves a lot of measuring, patterning, and sewing as most fabric work does, but also involves a good amount of prop making. Each costume can take up to 8 months to make, and while the process can be quite long and difficult, the end result of a completed, well-made costume is well worth the work. To date, I have a little more than 10 costumes that I rotate between when I go to events and conventions. These events are very close to my heart and I always enjoy meeting others who participate in the practice and showing off my work.</p>
        <p>Outside of costume creation, however, my work is contained mostly in the world of digital art. Rarely do I paint pictures on a canvas or sculpt with clay or stone. I seek beauty in everything I draw and prefer to create designs that are pleasing to the eye. I create character designs through digital art. Through digital art, I want to create interesting and engaging characters for video games and animations. Delivering a specific message through my work isn’t a priority for me, and I simply want to create art that is beautiful. As stated earlier, Japanese culture has inspired a majority of my work, and I take many elements from anime and manga, as well as Harajuku fashion to create my pieces. </p>
        <p>I don’t display my work in galleries or create installations, but post my work online for others to enjoy instead. I find the ease of accessibility and ability to share with others worldwide the internet provides suitable for the art that I create. Displaying my work in galleries or installations just isn’t the type of context that I believe fits my work. In this time of quarantine especially, being able to post my work and communicate with others through social media has helped me keep up my motivation to continue making art.  To me, being able to share my art with people all over the world without the need to leave my home satisfying enough for me.</p>
