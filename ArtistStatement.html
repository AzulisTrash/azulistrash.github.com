<p>Ever since I was a child, digital media has always been a large part of my life, especially in the case of video games. I grew up playing games such as Pokemon and The Legend of Zelda. Along with that, I also watched many animated shows on TV and online such as Sailor Moon or the Winx Club. It was those games and shows that inspired me to become an artist and I often found myself drawing the characters during my free time. I started drawing when I was 13 years old. It was soon after that when I turned 14, I started expanding my artistry into the digital world. </p>
<p>My work is contained mostly in the world of digital art. Rarely do I paint pictures on a canvas or sculpt with clay or stone. I seek beauty in everything I draw and prefer to create designs that are pleasing to the eye. I create character designs through digital art. Through digital art, I want to create interesting and engaging characters for video games and animations. Delivering a specific message through my work isn’t a priority for me, and I simply want to create art that is beautiful. I don’t display my work in galleries or create installations, but post my work online for others to enjoy instead. I find the ease of accessibility and ability to share with others worldwide the internet provides suitable for the art that I create. Displaying my work in galleries or installations just isn’t the type of context that I believe fits my work. To me, being able to share my art with people all over the world without the need to leave my home satisfying enough for me.
